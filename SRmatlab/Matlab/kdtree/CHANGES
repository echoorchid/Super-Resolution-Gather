This file describes changes and the moment they took place.

2 DEC 2008
- added distances as return parameter to kNN query 
- corrected distances (reversed) for kNN query 
- corrected distances (sqrt) for Ball query

12 NOV 2008
- Added "rules" to makefile instead of specific names
- Query calls are ubiquitous to column or row vectors [kx1] or [1xk] have same importance
- Generally improved argument checks
- SOLVED BUG: kdtree_k_nearest_neighbors crash when passed with only one argument
- SOLVED BUG: kdtree_build crash when invoked on a structure rather than a matrix
- addded fulltest script 


11 NOV 2008
- created a new version of the constructor which has a ~10x enhancement in speed
  along the lines of Steven Michael implementation. The libary now implements the 
  heapsort based version.

  Here below the comparison of performances which are acheived (seconds)
  data size:         1000    2000        4000      8000     16000     32000     64000
  standard:        0.0609    0.0531    0.1913    0.7248    2.8900   11.4816   46.3395
  no vector copy:  0.0093    0.0175    0.0580    0.2042    0.7716    2.9716   11.8726
  using heapsort:  0.0048    0.0137    0.0377    0.1183    0.4090    1.4814   5.66588

30 OCT 2008
- added kdtree destructor to be able to free memory within matlab
  scripts

15 OCT 2008
- added "distances" return parameter to kdtree_ball_query
- created the stub for the dist mode
- create a memory-freer for the KDTree named kdtree_delete
